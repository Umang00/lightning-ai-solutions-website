## 2.2 Deposits and Initial Payments

**Non-Refundable After Work Starts:** Deposits are non-refundable once any work has commenced (research, planning, setup, or development).

**Refundable Window:** Deposits are fully refundable if you cancel before any work begins AND within 7 days of payment.

    title: "3. Fixed-Price Project Refunds",
    content: `**Milestone-Based Billing:** Projects are typically billed at milestones (e.g., 30% deposit, 30% at midpoint, 40% at completion).

**Completed Work Policy:**
- You pay only for completed and approved milestones
- If you cancel mid-project, you are responsible for completed work plus any work-in-progress

**Refund Calculation:**
- If you've paid for a milestone not yet completed, we will refund the portion not yet earned
- Work-in-progress will be charged proportionally
- No refunds after final deliverables are provided and accepted

**Example:**
Project cost: ₹100,000 (50% deposit, 50% on completion)
